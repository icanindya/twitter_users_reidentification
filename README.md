# Reidentifying Twitter Users
This project aims to reveal the the real identities of Twitter users using US Voter Registration Records.




## Data Collection

Using Selenium automation tool we upload email addresses from Florida Voter Records to our Email contacts one-by-one and then ask Twitter to import our contacts. If the person has a Twitter account and gives consent to find him by email address then Twitter shows the corresponding Twitter account. 


For voters of Florida we have-

* | First Name | Middle Name | Age | Gender | Race | Party | City | Email

For Twitter users we have-

* | Twitter Name | Twitter Handle | Tweets | Followers | Following | Email

We match these
